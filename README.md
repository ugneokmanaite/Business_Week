# BUSINESS WEEK 1 (15-19 June)
This repo contains material from Week 1 of Sparta Academy Training. 

Content include:

- [x] Time & Task Management
- [x] Communication I
- [x] Communication II
- [x] Software Development Methodologies
- [x] Working in Project Teams




# Project Environment
Objectives
1. BAU vs Project work
2. Project lifecycle
3. Identifying business roles & their function in project environment
4. Key Project Knowledge

**BAU** = normal execution & standard operations- Uncomplex & straightforward strategies
**Project Work** = Unique & transient with desired outcome 

_Project Lifecycle_
1. Initiation
2. Planning 
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & Controlling
5. Closing

*** there will be health checks of project in tech before handing it over

*** Different stages define features & functions of a project (What needs to be achieved & the work that must be done for project to be delivered)

THE TRIPLE CONSTRAINT: TIME, COST, QUALITY (SCOPE IN MIDDLE)

- NETFLIX CASE STUDY: Adopted microservices architecture and migrated services to cloud AWS- 6 years 
https://www.computerworld.com/article/3427839/ten-years-on--how-netflix-completed-a-historic-cloud-migration-with-aws.html

**_The POPIT Model (The Holistic Triangle)_**

Advantages of projects being managed well
- Risks are identified prior to starting projects- improves confidence and allows better project management
- Projects are more likely to be on time, within cost & quality & scope restraints

# Software Lifecycle
Objectives-  Methodologies introduced:
1. Waterfall 
2. V-Model
4. Agile

_Waterfall_
- 'Traditional' linear approach
- Each stage finishes before another begings
- Used when requirements are clear
- Lack of adaptability

_V-Model_
- Follows a sequential & parallel flow of product development
- Verification process: Confirm that the system fulfils the design requirements
- Validation: Confirms that the system complies wth stakeholder requirements 

_Agile_
- Iterating through cycles, typically in sprints and retrospectives 
- PLAN (DESIGN), DO (CODE), CHECK (TEST)

# **Scrum**

- **AGILE: METHODOLOGY
- SCRUM: FRAMEWORK**

- Definition : Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products

- Artifact- something that we make- a tool that solves a problem or a tool that inspires

- 3 artifacts: product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment

- Product and sprint backlog describe work to be done that will add value 

- Product increment is portion of the product completed during a sprint

- 3 share same goals- to maximise transparency and provide shared understanding of the work

_**Product Backlog**_

- List of everything we want development team to work related to product in development
- Making a single ordered list makes organisational priorities transparent to all internal stakeholders
- Single product owner is responsible for the ordering of product backlog-  which provides transparency to org about the decision making
- Process used to arrive at the order
- Dynamic artifact- constantly evolving 
- Product owner collaborate with development team to refine the product backlog ( on going activity that can require up to 10% of development teams time)

**_Sprint Backlog_** 
- Collaboratively created during sprint planning by the collaborative team
- It is their plan of how they will deliver the sprint goal and related backlog items during the current sprint
- Regularly updated as development team learns more
- Transparent real life picture of all work in current sprint

**_Product Increment_**
- Sum of all completed backlog items in a given sprint + value of previous increments
- Provides transparent picture of the state of the product at the end of each sprint
- Helps scrum teams realise that agile principle that "working software is primary measure of progress"
- Meets teams definition of done

_All these allow good decisions to be made through inspecting and adapting_

**Scrum Roles**
- 3 major that play part in Scrum Team
- Product owner: The product with product vision
- Scrum Master: The Scrum expert who helps the team build the product accordingly to Scrum Framework
- Development Team: The team members who execute the work
- Stakeholders: People who have genuine interest in product. They will keep reviewing the product, progress and keep providing feedback. 

**Scrum Events**
- Sprint Planning : A time boxed event occurs at the beginning of a sprint where the team determined the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint
- Daily Scrum: 15 min time-boxed event for development team to synchronise activities and create a plan for next 24 horus
- Sprint Review: A time-boxed event holds at the end of Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt Product Backlog if needed
- Sprint Retrospect: A time-boxed event for providing an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be carried out during next sprint

# Working in Project Teams

_Attributes of Mature Teams_
- Co-located
- Cross Functional
- Self organising
- Accountable & Empowered
- Test & Learn Feedback Loops

_Different roles within same environment_
- QA: Quality Assurance / Software Testers
- BA: Business Analysts
- PM: Project Managers
- DEV: Development

How to we make projects easier?
- Positive Environment
- Manage Conflict ****Intelligently****
- Have open and clear communication
- Respect all of your peers 
- Become trustworthy 

**Business Case**
1. Expected benefits/ disbeliefs
2. Execution timeline
3. Executive summary
4. Investment appraisal
5. Solutions- Operations
6. Major Risks
7. Stakeholders/ Communication plan

_All these go into business case (justification) for a Project._ 

Gathering information & facts (R&D)
- Requirements from clients

**_Return on Investment (ROI)_**
- Have to declare when the investment will return
- It all comes down to the worth of the product to the people who need it
- 
Risk
- The possibility of a commercial business making inadequate profits due to uncertainties 
- All projects have risks
- Expected/ Identified, Not identified

**Risk Identification Tools**
 _Brainstorming_ 

- S: Aids communication & introduces unexpected
- W: Needs strong facilitator, poor risk decription

_Prompt List_

- S: Captures experience, focused controlled responses
- W: Limits creativity, can miss specific risks

_Delphi_

- S: Experts & Can be done remotely
- W: Depends on identifying experts, timely

_SWOT_

- S: Focus on Opp & Threats
- W: Time consuming, simplistic

_Previous Experience_

- S: Actual events
- W: Individual experience can be subjective

_**Dealing with RISKS**_
- Exploit 
- Share
- Enhance 
- Avoidance
- Transfer
- Reduce
- Accept 
- Ignore (YOU CANNOT IGNORE)

# _Stakeholders_
- Anyone with an interest / can create an impact
- Power / Interest Grid 

_Stakeholder Attitudes_
- Champion 
- Supporter
- Neutral 
- Critic
- Opponent
- Blocker

Project Planning
- More time on planning = less on execution 
- Key for a successful project
- Involves setting out road map for project : _Project Plan, Resource Plan, Financial Plan, Quality, Acceptance, Communication Plan_

# Network Diagrams
- Planning Technique used for task breakdown

_How to create_
1. Task breakdown
2. Estimation of durations
3. Understand logical dependencies- **Precedence Table**
4. Create ND
5. Gannt Chart 

_Task Breakdown_
- Always is discussed within a team environment when making decisions

_Estimation_
- Time & Cost aspect
- Need to provide accurate timings and have a buffer ready
- PjM will have a buffer to add additional time for delays, unforeseen circumstances etc
- Documents from previous projects are considered to go through lessons learned in order or risks/ uncertainties to be considered
- Buffer time will be added for these risks

_Logical Dependencies_
- Every task may have dependencies
- It is key to understand all tasks associated & organise these in a logical order
- E.g. The creation of ____ is dependant on ____
- Need to have a simplistic approach to avoid confusion

_Logical Dependencies- Precedence Table_
- Dependencies presented in table to clearly establish them
- There should be a clear Start & End Node

_Network Diagram_
- The Precedence table is converted into a simple diagram to illustrate what needs to be done in what order
- Allows us to see the logical order of our activities to define critical path
- Anything else will take the project into red zone
- If there is no start note make a box with 0 (as good practice)
- Critical path is the longest path through the network- gives you a logical estimate  & _has 0 float_

`Activity on Node (AoN) = 
EST : Earliest Start Date, 
LST : Latest Start Date, 
Dur : Duration , 
Flt : Float `

Calculating AoN

- Earliest Start = Left to right - `Early Start + Duration` . If there are 2 dependencies we take the longest one!
- Latest Start = Right to left - `Latest start time (on right) - Duration (on left)`- If they don't give you first early start then start on 0! 
- Duration is always given
- Float = Left to right - `Latest start + Earliest Start`

_Rules_
- ND flow from left to right 
- It is key to make it easily readable = to prove your thought processes to other people 
- There can be more than 1 critical path 
- Arrows can cross over each other without any impact
- Looping is not allowed
- Conditional statements are not allowed- the network diagram is not a decision tree
- Activities can occur only once
- Earliest start of the last activity should always equal to the Latest Finish
- When there are multiple starts, a common start note can be used to indicate a clear project beginning on the network. 
- A single project end node can be used to indicate a clear ending.
