for improvements to be carried out during next sprint

# Working in Project Teams

_Attributes of Mature Teams_
- Co-located
- Cross Functional
- Self organising
- Accountable & Empowered
- Test & Learn Feedback Loops

_Different roles within same environment_
- QA: Quality Assurance / Software Testers
- BA: Business Analysts
- PM: Project Managers
- DEV: Development

How to we make projects easier?
- Positive Environment
- Manage Conflict ****Intelligently****
- Have open and clear communication
- Respect all of your peers 
- Become trustworthy 

**Business Case**
1. Expected benefits/ disbeliefs
2. Execution timeline
3. Executive summary
4. Investment appraisal
5. Solutions- Operations
6. Major Risks
7. Stakeholders/ Communication plan

_All these go into business case (justification) for a Project._ 

Gathering information & facts (R&D)
- Requirements from clients

**_Return on Investment (ROI)_**
- Have to declare when the investment will return
- It all comes down to the worth of the product to the people who need it
- 
Risk
- The possibility of a commercial business making inadequate profits due to uncertainties 
- All projects have risks
- Expected/ Identified, Not identified

**Risk Identification Tools**
 _Brainstorming_ 

- S: Aids communication & introduces unexpected
- W: Needs strong facilitator, poor risk decription

_Prompt List_

- S: Captures experience, focused controlled responses
- W: Limits creativity, can miss specific risks

_Delphi_

- S: Experts & Can be done remotely
- W: Depends on identifying experts, timely

_SWOT_

- S: Focus on Opp & Threats
- W: Time consuming, simplistic

_Previous Experience_

- S: Actual events
- W: Individual experience can be subjective

_**Dealing with RISKS**_
- Exploit 
- Share
- Enhance 
- Avoidance
- Transfer
- Reduce
- Accept 
- Ignore (YOU CANNOT IGNORE)

# _Stakeholders_
- Anyone with an interest / can create an impact
- Power / Interest Grid 

_Stakeholder Attitudes_
- Champion 
- Supporter
- Neutral 
- Critic
- Opponent
- Blocker

Project Planning
- More time on planning = less on execution 
- Key for a successful project
- Involves setting out road map for project : _Project Plan, Resource Plan, Financial Plan, Quality, Acceptance, Communication Plan_

# Network Diagrams
- Planning Technique used for task breakdown

_How to create_
1. Task breakdown
2. Estimation of durations
3. Understand logical dependencies- **Precedence Table**
4. Create ND
5. Gannt Chart 

_Task Breakdown_
- Always is discussed within a team environment when making decisions

_Estimation_
- Time & Cost aspect
- Need to provide accurate timings and have a buffer ready
- PjM will have a buffer to add additional time for delays, unforeseen circumstances etc
- Documents from previous projects are considered to go through lessons learned in order or risks/ uncertainties to be considered
- Buffer time will be added for these risks

_Logical Dependencies_
- Every task may have dependencies
- It is key to understand all tasks associated & organise these in a logical order
- E.g. The creation of ____ is dependant on ____
- Need to have a simplistic approach to avoid confusion

_Logical Dependencies- Precedence Table_
- Dependencies presented in table to clearly establish them
- There should be a clear Start & End Node

_Network Diagram_
- The Precedence table is converted into a simple diagram to illustrate what needs to be done in what order
- Allows us to see the logical order of our activities to define critical path
- Anything else will take the project into red zone
- If there is no start note make a box with 0 (as good practice)
- Critical path is the longest path through the network- gives you a logical estimate  & _has 0 float_

`Activity on Node (AoN) = 
EST : Earliest Start Date, 
LST : Latest Start Date, 
Dur : Duration , 
Flt : Float `

Calculating AoN

- Earliest Start = Left to right - `Early Start + Duration` . If there are 2 dependencies we take the longest one!
- Latest Start = Right to left - `Latest start time (on right) - Duration (on left)`- If they don't give you first early start then start on 0! 
- Duration is always given
- Float = Left to right - `Latest start + Earliest Start`

_Rules_
- ND flow from left to right 
- It is key to make it easily readable = to prove your thought processes to other people 
- There can be more than 1 critical path 
- Arrows can cross over each other without any impact
- Looping is not allowed
- Conditional statements are not allowed- the network diagram is not a decision tree
- Activities can occur only once
- Earliest start of the last activity should always equal to the Latest Finish
- When there are multiple starts, a common start note can be used to indicate a clear project beginning on the network. 
- A single project end node can be used to indicate a clear ending. 

_Examples of Techniques for Analysis_
- MOST

- Porters Five Forces
- PESTLE
- SWOT
- Workshops
- Interviews
- Questionnaires
