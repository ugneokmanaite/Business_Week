# Project Environment

Objectives
- [x] BAU vs Project work
- [x] Project lifecycle
- [x] Identifying business roles & their function in project environment
- [x] Key Project Knowledge

**BAU** = normal execution & standard operations- Uncomplex & straightforward strategies
**Project Work** = Unique & transient with desired outcome 

##_Project Lifecycle_
1. Initiation
2. Planning 
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & Controlling
5. Closing

*** there will be health checks of project in tech before handing it over

*** Different stages define features & functions of a project (What needs to be achieved & the work that must be done for project to be delivered)

THE TRIPLE CONSTRAINT: TIME, COST, QUALITY (SCOPE IN MIDDLE)

- NETFLIX CASE STUDY: Adopted microservices architecture and migrated services to cloud AWS- 6 years

## **_The POPIT Model (The Holistic Triangle)_**

Advantages of projects being managed well
- Risks are identified prior to starting projects- improves confidence and allows better project management
- Projects are more likely to be on time, within cost & quality & scope restraints

## Software Lifecycle
Objectives-  Methodologies introduced:
1. Waterfall

2. V-Model

3. Agile

## Waterfall
- 'Traditional' linear approach
- Each stage finishes before another begings
- Used when requirements are clear
- Lack of adaptability

## V-Model
- Follows a sequential & parallel flow of product development
- Verification process: Confirm that the system fulfils the design requirements
- Validation: Confirms that the system complies wth stakeholder requirements 

## Agile
- Iterating through cycles, typically in sprints and retrospectives 
- PLAN (DESIGN), DO (CODE), CHECK (TEST)

## Scrum

- **AGILE: METHODOLOGY
- SCRUM: FRAMEWORK**

![image](https://tech.gsa.gov/assets/img/guides/Maxxor_Scrum.jpg)

- Definition : Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products

- Artifact- something that we make- a tool that solves a problem or a tool that inspires

- 3 artifacts: product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment

- Product and sprint backlog describe work to be done that will add value 

- Product increment is portion of the product completed during a sprint

- 3 share same goals- to maximise transparency and provide shared understanding of the work

## Product Backlog

- List of everything we want development team to work related to product in development
- Making a single ordered list makes organisational priorities transparent to all internal stakeholders
- Single product owner is responsible for the ordering of product backlog-  which provides transparency to org about the decision making
- Process used to arrive at the order
- Dynamic artifact- constantly evolving 
- Product owner collaborate with development team to refine the product backlog ( on going activity that can require up to 10% of development teams time)

## **_Sprint Backlog_** 
- Collaboratively created during sprint planning by the collaborative team
- It is their plan of how they will deliver the sprint goal and related backlog items during the current sprint
- Regularly updated as development team learns more
- Transparent real life picture of all work in current sprint

## **_Product Increment_**
- Sum of all completed backlog items in a given sprint + value of previous increments
- Provides transparent picture of the state of the product at the end of each sprint
- Helps scrum teams realise that agile principle that "working software is primary measure of progress"
- Meets teams definition of done

_All these allow good decisions to be made through inspecting and adapting_

## *Scrum Roles*
- 3 major that play part in Scrum Team
- Product owner: The product with product vision
- Scrum Master: The Scrum expert who helps the team build the product accordingly to Scrum Framework
- Development Team: The team members who execute the work
- Stakeholders: People who have genuine interest in product. They will keep reviewing the product, progress and keep providing feedback. 

## **Scrum Events**
- Sprint Planning : A time boxed event occurs at the beginning of a sprint where the team determined the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint
- Daily Scrum: 15 min time-boxed event for development team to synchronise activities and create a plan for next 24 horus
- Sprint Review: A time-boxed event holds at the end of Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt Product Backlog if needed
- Sprint Retrospect: A time-boxed event for providing an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
